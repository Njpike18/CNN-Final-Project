# CNN-Final-Project
Final Project for CN530 in which Simulations of Convolutional Neural Networks representing multiple biological models of vision were compared against eachother.
There are simulations of the human model of vision (CN530Assign2.m), Rat visual model (rat_vision.m and rat_receptivefield.m), and of the vertebrate model of vision, attempting to account for polarized light detection (polarized_vision.m)
